Introduced in 2016 by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, and Ali Farhadi, YOLO models are known for their speed and accuracy. These models predict the position of bounding boxes and classification probabilities for objects in an image in a single pass, making them efficient for real-time applications. This models verion is YOLOv11"
